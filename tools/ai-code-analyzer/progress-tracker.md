- `/tools/ai-code-analyzer/architecture.md` (CREATED - 🏗️ Comprehensive technical architecture)
- `/tools/ai-code-analyzer/README.md` (CREATED - 📖 Professional project documentation)

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- **Framework**: Python 3.11+ with async/await patterns for performance
- **CLI**: Click/Typer for command-line interface with Rich for beautiful UI
- **Config**: Pydantic v2 for configuration management and validation
- **Testing**: pytest with async support, >90% coverage target
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based system with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive self-documenting system with progress tracking

**Code Patterns Established**:
```python
# Async-first approach for I/O operations
async def analyze_project(path: Path) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Analyze project with resume capability."""
    pass

# Pydantic for configuration with validation
class AnalyzerConfig(BaseSettings):
    max_tokens: int = Field(default=4000, ge=100, le=32000)
    timeout_seconds: int = Field(default=300, ge=30, le=3600)
    
    @validator('timeout_seconds')
    def validate_timeout(cls, v):
        return max(30, min(v, 3600))  # 30 seconds to 1 hour

# Plugin architecture pattern
class BaseAnalyzer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def analyze(self, context: AnalysisContext) -> AnalysisResult:
        pass
```

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for CLI, analysis engine, LLM management, session handling
- **Plugin System**: Extensible analyzer registry for different project types
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Abstracted LLM interface with intelligent provider selection
- **Resume Capability**: Checkpoint-based session management for long-running analyses
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Professional user experience with progress indicators

**Learning/Insights**:
- The original shell script has excellent quota management - need to preserve this intelligence
- Modular architecture is crucial for supporting multiple project types
- Self-documentation and resume capability are key differentiators
- **Key Innovation**: The combination of intelligent quota management + resume capability + multi-LLM support creates a unique value proposition
- **Architecture Insight**: Plugin-based analyzers allow for easy extension to new project types and analysis methods
- **UX Insight**: Rich terminal UI can make complex analysis processes feel approachable and professional
- **Technical Insight**: Async architecture with proper error handling enables resilient long-running operations

**Documentation Strategy**:
- **Self-Managing**: Created comprehensive tracking system that guides future development
- **Architecture-First**: Detailed technical design before implementation prevents scope creep
- **User-Focused**: README emphasizes benefits and ease of use
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear contribution guidelines and development standards
