### Enhanced AI Service Cleanup (August 5, 2025)
- **File**: [Enhanced AI Service Cleanup](./enhanced-ai-service-cleanup.md)
- **Type**: Code Refactoring and Cleanup
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Impact**: Removed 80KB+ of unused hardware-adaptive AI code
- **Files Modified**: `backend/app/services/enhanced_ai_service.py`

**Summary**: Successfully removed unused hardware-adaptive AI system components while maintaining all core functionality. Simplified codebase architecture, improved maintainability, and eliminated dead code paths.

**Key Changes**:
