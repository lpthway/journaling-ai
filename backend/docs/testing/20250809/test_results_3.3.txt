=== Connection Pool Optimization Test Results ===

**Test Date:** Sa 9. Aug 09:34:22 CEST 2025
**Task:** 3.3 Connection Pool Optimization

## Test Results Summary:
✅ Python syntax validation: All modules compile successfully
✅ Database imports: All imports working correctly  
✅ Pool configuration: Optimal size calculated (50 connections, 20 overflow)
✅ Metrics system: Connection metrics operational
✅ Health checks: Database health monitoring functional
✅ Configuration: DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=10, DB_POOL_SIZE=20

## Pool Optimization Features Tested:
✅ Adaptive pool sizing based on system resources (28 CPU cores)
✅ Connection pool metrics tracking 
✅ Health check system operational
✅ Configuration optimization active

## Performance Configuration Validated:
- Pool Size: 50 connections (adaptive)
- Max Overflow: 20 connections  
- Pool Recycle: 7200 seconds (2 hours, load-adjusted)
- Pool Timeout: 30 seconds

All connection pool optimization features tested and operational.
