## Summary

The `frontend/src/services` directory contains a well-structured but monolithic API service layer with both strengths and significant areas for improvement. The centralized approach provides consistency, but the codebase shows signs of evolution with legacy patterns, duplicated methods, and missing modern error handling practices. 

**Priority Issues**: API duplication (`api.js:135-141`), production console logging, and lack of request cancellation capabilities should be addressed immediately.

**Architecture Assessment**: The current single-file approach works for the current scale but should be refactored into domain-specific modules for better maintainability as the application grows.
