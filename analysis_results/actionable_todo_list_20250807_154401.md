I have created a comprehensive, actionable TODO list based on the comprehensive assessment. The document is structured with 5 priority levels:

## PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL FIXES (5 items - 20 hours)
- Fix broken navigation route (2h)
- Replace pickle serialization security issue (4h) 
- Fix hardcoded secrets (3h)
- Re-enable Sessions API (6h)
- Fix AI model memory leaks (5h)

## PRIORITY 2: HIGH IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (5 items - 50 hours)
- Remove production console logging (4h)
- Bundle optimization - duplicate libraries (6h)
- TypeScript migration Phase 1 (20h)
- Fix N+1 database queries (8h)
- Component decomposition (12h)

## PRIORITY 3: CODE QUALITY (4 items - 50 hours)
- Comprehensive testing suite (16h)
- Authentication system (20h)
- Connection pool optimization (6h)
- Circuit breaker pattern (8h)

## PRIORITY 4: DOCUMENTATION (4 items - 44 hours)
- API documentation (8h)
- Security audit (12h)
- Monitoring/observability (10h)
- End-to-end testing (14h)

## PRIORITY 5: ENHANCEMENT (3 items - 66+ hours)
- Performance optimization (16h)
- UI/UX enhancement (20h)
- Advanced AI features (30h+)

Each TODO item includes:
- Clear problem description
- Specific affected files with line numbers where applicable
- Realistic time estimates
- Success criteria
- Dependencies
- Testing requirements
- Implementation approach

The plan focuses on **immediate production blockers first**, then **high-impact stability improvements**, followed by **code quality** and **long-term enhancements**.

**Immediate next action**: Start with Priority 1 - the broken navigation route and security vulnerabilities are the most critical issues preventing production deployment.
