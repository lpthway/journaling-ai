## Q1: Should we maintain backwards compatibility during the JS-to-TypeScript conversion?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (safer to avoid breaking existing functionality during migration)
**Why this default:** Large codebases benefit from gradual migration to avoid regression risks

## Q2: Should we convert all React components (.jsx files) to TypeScript (.tsx) in this consolidation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent with TypeScript-first standard goal)
**Why this default:** Mixed file types create confusion and defeat the purpose of consolidation

## Q3: Should we add strict TypeScript configuration (strict mode) after consolidation?
**Default if unknown:** No (gradual strictness adoption is safer for existing codebase)
**Why this default:** Existing code may need adjustments before strict mode can be enabled

## Q4: Should we preserve all existing component functionality during the conversion?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consolidation should not change behavior, only improve maintainability)
**Why this default:** This is a refactoring task, not a feature change

## Q5: Should we update import statements and references throughout the codebase after file extensions change?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (broken imports would cause runtime errors)
**Why this default:** File extension changes require corresponding import updates to maintain functionality
