# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-11 21:30

## User Request
### 1. Frontend Code Consolidation
**Problem**: Duplicate App files and mixed JS/TypeScript usage
```
Current Issues:
- App.js AND App.tsx exist simultaneously
- Inconsistent TypeScript adoption
- Mixed file extensions across components
```

**Solution**:
- Remove `App.js`, keep `App.tsx` as primary
- Convert all `.js` files to `.tsx` where React components exist
- Establish TypeScript-first development standard
- Add proper type definitions for all props and state

**Impact**: Improved maintainability, better IDE support, reduced bundle size

## Context
This request was initiated following a successful authentication system implementation where we discovered duplicate App files causing confusion and inconsistent development standards.
