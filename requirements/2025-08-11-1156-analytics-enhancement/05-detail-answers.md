# Expert Answers - System Architecture Decisions

## Q1: Should we migrate the frontend to use the optimized `/insights/cached` endpoint instead of the legacy `/entries/analytics/*` endpoints?
**Answer:** YES (and check if analytics_service is even needed)

**Additional Investigation Required:** Need to evaluate if the complex `analytics_service.py` system is actually necessary or if the existing unified database service with Redis caching is sufficient for the performance requirements.

## Q2: Is there a way to preserve all the metrics and insights without breaking anything during migration?
**Answer:** YES (based on the working dashboard shown)

**Evidence:** The dashboard shows comprehensive analytics are working:
- Mood Distribution (32 entries, sentiment breakdown)
- Writing Activity heatmap (4 months of data)
- Detailed insights (Writing, Emotional Patterns, Progress Tracking)
- Personality Profile with Big Five dimensions

**Migration Strategy:** Preserve existing functionality by enhancing the current system rather than replacing it.
