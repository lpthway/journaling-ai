# Discovery Answers

## Q1: Is the analytics system currently recreating all data from scratch on every request?
**Answer:** YES

**Evidence:** The provided logs show continuous emotion analysis being performed on multiple entries (over 25 entries processed sequentially from 11:52:45 to 11:52:57), indicating the system is reprocessing individual entries rather than using cached aggregate data. Each entry is being analyzed with both sentiment and emotion models, suggesting the cache is either not working or not being used effectively.

**Impact:** This explains potential performance issues and resource consumption during analytics requests.

## Q2: Are users experiencing noticeable delays when viewing analytics/insights?
**Answer:** YES

**Impact:** Users are experiencing significant loading delays when accessing analytics, which creates poor user experience and likely causes users to abandon the analytics page before it finishes loading.

## Q3: Do you want to maintain real-time accuracy of analytics data?
**Answer:** YES (if possible and not too costly)

**Preference:** Real-time data accuracy is preferred, but performance and cost are also important considerations. This suggests we need a solution that can provide near real-time data without sacrificing performance.

## Q4: Is the current file-based JSON caching system sufficient for your scale?
**Answer:** NO

**Available Infrastructure:** Redis, PostgreSQL, and ChromaDB are available and could be leveraged for much better caching and analytics storage:
- **Redis:** Perfect for fast in-memory caching of computed analytics results
- **PostgreSQL:** Ideal for persistent storage of processed analytics data and incremental updates
- **ChromaDB:** Could enable semantic analytics and pattern discovery

**Opportunity:** The current JSON file-based system should be replaced with a multi-tier caching strategy using these robust data stores.

## Q5: Should analytics work offline or handle partial connectivity?
**Answer:** NO

**Requirement:** Analytics will be an online-only feature, which simplifies the architecture and allows us to focus on server-side optimization without worrying about offline data synchronization.
