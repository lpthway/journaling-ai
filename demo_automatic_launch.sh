# Simulate the enhanced behavior
echo "📋 When quota is exhausted, the main script will now:"
echo "   1. ✅ Parse quota reset time"
echo "   2. ✅ Create intelligent auto-resume script"
echo "   3. 🚀 AUTOMATICALLY launch the auto-resume script in background"
echo "   4. ✅ Show you the process ID and log file location"
echo "   5. ✅ Exit cleanly, leaving the background process running"
echo ""

echo "🤖 Simulating automatic launch..."
echo "▶️  Launching auto-resume script..."

# Show what the nohup command will do
echo "   Command: nohup bash quota_resume_TIMESTAMP.sh > quota_resume_TIMESTAMP.log 2>&1 &"
echo ""

echo "✅ Auto-resume script started successfully!"
echo "   Process ID: 12345 (example)"
echo "   Log file: quota_resume_TIMESTAMP.log"
echo ""

echo "🎉 All done! Your analysis will automatically continue at 17:00"
echo "💡 You can now close this terminal - the background process will handle everything"
echo ""

echo "🔍 To monitor progress later:"
echo "   • Check logs: tail -f quota_resume_TIMESTAMP.log"
echo "   • View running processes: ps aux | grep quota_resume"
echo "   • Manual resume: ./claude_analysis.sh --resume"
echo "   • Cancel auto-resume: killall -f quota_resume_TIMESTAMP.sh"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Key Benefits:"
echo "   ✅ Zero manual intervention required"
echo "   ✅ Background process survives terminal closure"
echo "   ✅ Automatic countdown and Claude testing"
echo "   ✅ Logs everything for monitoring"
echo "   ✅ Safe to walk away from your computer"
