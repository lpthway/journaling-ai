#### 5. Enhanced Chat Service LLM Fix
- **File**: `backend/app/services/enhanced_chat_service.py`
- **Issue**: LLM service parameter mismatch causing chat response failures
- **Solution**: Corrected generate_response call parameters
- **Changes**: Fixed parameter names to match LLM service interface (prompt, context only)
- **Impact**: Restored enhanced chat functionality with emotion analysis

#### 6. Advanced AI Service Cache Updates
- **File**: `backend/app/services/advanced_ai_service.py`
- **Issue**: Using deprecated cache methods
